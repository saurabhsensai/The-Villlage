# The-Villlage


This project deals with study and development of village as a Digital/Smart village.
We define digital village as bundle of services of which are delivered to its residence
and businesses in an effective and efficient manner. The basic concept of digital village
is to collect community efforts and strength of people from various streams and integrate it with information technology to provide benefits to the rural community. It also makes the village self-sufficient in respect of their needs and focuses on improved resource use efficiency, local self-governance, access to assure basic amenities and responsible individual and community behavior to build happy society. We are making digital village by taking smart decisions using smart technologies and services.
